# Nixos
    - Lutris runners are not well documented or set.
# Wezterm
    - Tabs are not quite there, a picker would be nice
    - Theming isn't quite set yet
# Neovim
    - Default lsp settings changed on newest update
        - Diagnostics are not shown by default.
        - Got some warning about a deprecated setting.
    - Luabar visuals made it non-transparent after last update.

    - Direnv (prob gotta fork or make my own, don't lsp until it loads, etc...)
    - Completion
        - Docs are not transparent.
    - Folds
    - Yazi isn't too well integrated (theming, and renaming).
    - Snippets and templates, never expanded them tbh.
    - Snacks
        - General setup, I didn't do proper config yet.
        - Numbar is lacking, they won't fix it either. (Disabled for now)
        - Because of the above, should I look for another way to mark folds?
        - Animations, if not enough then mini.animations has it.
    - Proper theming based on nixos inputs (or just base16 in general).
