# Nixos
    - Lutris runners are not well documented or set.
# Wezterm
    - Tabs are not quite there, a picker would be nice
    - Theming isn't quite set yet
# Neovim
    - Default lsp settings changed on newest update
    - Luabar visuals made it non-transparent after last update.
    - Direnv (prob gotta fork or make my own, don't lsp until it loads, etc...)
    - Completion
        - Docs are not transparent.
    - Folds
    - Yazi isn't too well integrated (theming, and renaming).
    - Snippets and templates, never expanded them tbh.
    - Snacks
        - General setup, I didn't do proper config yet.
        - Animations, if not enough then mini.animations has it.
        - Blink breaks because of animations sometimes
        - Indent is cool because of animation, however it doesn't let me hide top level indent.
    - Proper theming based on nixos inputs (or just base16 in general).
